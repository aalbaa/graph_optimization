# To do
The code is divided into two main parts
1.  creating vertex and edge types, and
2.  setting and solving the graph optimization.

# Today:
1. Create base vertex class
2. Create base edge class
3. Implement a linear base vertex class from the base vertex class
4. Implement a linear base edge class from the base edge class
